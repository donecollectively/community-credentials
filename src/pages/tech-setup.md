A brief guide to your tech setup

## Getting Connected with Eternl

To register a credential entry on this site, you'll need to connect the preproduction testnet using the Eternl wallet.   We intend to support additional wallets in an upcoming release.

If you're familiar with wallet setup on Cardano, just do what you know, connecting Eternl to the proprod network.

### Guided Setup

If you need guidance on Eternl setup, we'll direct you to an article provided by the creators of the Eternl wallet. 

**Note** that this guide starts with the default ("mainnet") configuration - so be sure to click the purple "mainnet" indicator in the lower-right corner of Eternl, to select "preprod" - and then the detailed, step-by-step instructions on [this site](https://builtoncardano.com/blog/how-to-create-an-eternl-wallet) should serve you nicely.

To fund your new wallet, **select the PREPROD testnet environment** at this [testnet faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/) page, and paste your wallet address (from step-by-step guide at the link above).  Your test "funds" will arrive shortly.

### Using an existing testnet wallet

If you already have a preprod testnet wallet using some other wallet software, feel free to restore that same wallet into Eternl, using your existing mnemonics.  Simply select the Restore wallet option in Eternl after choosing the preprod testnet.

## Be Careful!

A few pointers and recommendations for wallet safety:

  * Never share your mnemonics with others
  * Use entirely separate credentials for testnet and mainnet wallets
  * Keep clear separation and a separate zone of security for testnet activity
