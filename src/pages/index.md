## SSI Credentialing by and for Web&nbsp;3 Communities

### Why SSI Credentials?

Every organization and every community needs to know that they can get access 
to people having key skillsets for effective delivery on their mission.  

Rigorous interviews, college degrees, and "who you know" referrals can be helpful, 
but each can have its drawbacks, including **scalability**, **reliability**, **lack of privacy**, and trust-related risk.

Self-Sovereign Identity and **Verifiable Credentials** are an additional path 
that can help every community and organization simplify onboarding and reduce
some of the costs of **building human trust**.
