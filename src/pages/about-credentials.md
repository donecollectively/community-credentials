How do digital credentials work?

---

Verifiable credentials are typically issued to a person, in a way that allows them to **present** their credential to a software program or application, in a way that keeps their identity safe.  Normally, an extremely limited amount of (often, zero) personal information is included in the credential.

This **verifiable presentation** does, however, include certain key attributes about the **issuer**, that allow a **verifier** to cross-check that the credential being presented has been issued by an organization whose **credential program** they trust.
